DAT250 - Assignment 2

## What i implementet
- Sping boot backend project (java 21).
- GitHub Actions: Gradle build and tests with JaCoCo.
- Domain entities from PollApp.
- PollManager.
- Started on a HTTP Client.


## Technical problems
1. GitHub Actions didnt run when pushing changes to main. Solved by doing reaserch and adding workflow_dispatch.
   Ive never used Actions and workflows before, and im also not that good with github in general, so i used a lot of time figuring this step of the exercise out. 

## Pending issues
Assignment 1 is complete, but 2 is not. I used a lot of time implementing the PollManager, so i did not have much more time trying the rest of tasks in the exercise. 
One reason for not finishing in time is because of the assignments deadline time. Ive never seen a hand-in deadline 10:15 in the moring, and i naturally just assumed 23:59. So lack of time is mainly the reson.
Secondly, implementing the domain model without adding the relationships between the different entities directly in the domain classes was difficult. 
Maybe i missunderstod what the task asked for, but I have never implemented a model in this way before, so it felt like i was doing the wrong thing and tok a lot of time. 

If i had have more time i am sure i would have completed the assignment.
